 * Are kmin and kmax limits for CAMB OK?
 * Make the code calculate matter power itself, so it controls kmax/kmin
 * Get code to cache results of CAMB calculations
 * Why doesn't using Combined mode result in better constraints on M_nu? What does the Fisher integrand look like at high k?
 * Make it so that the user specifies the list of parameters that should be returned, rather than hard-coding them.
