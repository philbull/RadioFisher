Cosmology Fisher forecasting code for HI (21cm) intensity mapping experiments.

Released under the Academic Free License (AFL-3.0).


REQUIREMENTS
------------

 - Python (tested with 2.7)
 - Recent NumPy and SciPy
 - matplotlib
 - mpi4py
 - CAMB (http://camb.info/)


INSTALLATION
------------

This is a collection of Python scripts, none of which need to be compiled or 
installed before use. However, you should compile CAMB and change the CAMB_EXEC 
variable in baofisher.py to point at this executable.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

This code is still under heavy development, so you might need to get your hands 
a little dirty. The bulk of the forecasting code is in baofisher.py, along with 
a bunch of convenience functions for manipulating and plotting Fisher matrices.

To get up and running quickly, run full_survey.py like so:

  $ mpirun -n <num_procs> ./full_survey <survey_id>

This will calculate Fisher matrices for a given pre-defined survey (see the top 
of full_survey.py and the definitions in experiments.py for survey/experiment 
settings and fiducial cosmological parameters), for a range of redshift bins. 
The Fisher matrix for each z-bin is stored in the output/ subdirectory.

You can then use the individual plotting scripts to combine and plot the Fisher 
matrices in various ways, to produce various forecasts for cosmological 
parameters. This is where you'll really have to get your hands dirty modifying 
scripts (or using them as templates for your own scripts), depending on what 
constraints you want to look at.
